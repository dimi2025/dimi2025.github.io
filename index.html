        <h2>About Dimitrios Spanos</h2>
        <p>Hello, I’m Dimitrios Spanos — a screenwriter, mythopoeic architect, and creator of high-concept cinematic IPs designed for global impact.

My creative focus lies in building deeply structured narrative ecosystems that blend high-stakes action, speculative science, espionage, and philosophical inquiry. With a rigorous understanding of geopolitical shifts, emergent technologies, and mythic storytelling structures, I craft stories that resonate across cultures and mediums.

At the heart of my work is Horizon Absolute™ — not just a screenplay, but the foundation of a genre-defining narrative universe. Developed as a fully realized IP franchise, it serves as both a cinematic experience and a scalable transmedia model, with built-in architecture for screen, serialized storytelling, publishing, and beyond.

I believe the future of storytelling lies in IPs that are immersive, intelligent, and emotionally resonant. My mission is to engineer these worlds — narratives that entertain, challenge, and endure.</p>
